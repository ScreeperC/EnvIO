# Welcome to Rust for Programmers

Let’s get started with our Rust for Programmers course!

### Rust for Programmers

Rust for Programmers is a course intended for learners who are already familiar with the basics of programming and are looking to learn the Rust programming language.

This course is designed as a series of short articles which provide an in-depth exploration of all the crucial aspects of Rust. Each article is self-contained, so this course can be utilized as a comprehensive reference guide to assist you during development.

If you are already proficient in another programming language, you will find many concepts carry over into Rust. However, some concepts such as memory management might be new to even an experienced programmer.

If you have never programmed before, it may advisable to begin with an introductory course in a different language, such as [Learn Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) or [Learn C++](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus). Not only are those courses designed for learners new to programming, but an understanding of multiple languages will also help you understand Rust and the art of programming even more.
